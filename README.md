# Cancer-Classification

In this project, we work to predict if a patient suffuring from cancer is beningn or malignant.

Using historical data about patients diagnosed with cancer, enable the doctors to differentiate malignant cases and benign given the independent attributes.

# Data 

 -  ID number
 -  Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
 -  radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
 -  texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
 -  perimeter
 -  area
 -  smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
 -  compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
 -  concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
 -  concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
 -  symmetry
 -  fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
 -  The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
 -  All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.
 -  Missing attribute values: none
 -  Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
